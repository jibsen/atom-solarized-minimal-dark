# Solarized Minimal Dark for Atom

![Solarized Minimal Dark Sample](images/solmin-atom-dark-sample.png)

[Solarized Minimal][solmin] is a syntax theme using the [Solarized][]
palette by Ethan Schoonover. One of the unique features of Solarized is that
it supports both a dark and light theme, using the same sixteen colors.

[Atom][] supports syntax highlighting based on the format and grammar used in
TextMate. This makes it possible to theme pretty much any part of a document,
but that doesn't necessarily mean you should.

Solarized Minimal attempts to create a more homogeneous and subtle use of
the Solarized palette by assigning colors primarily through the root groups
described in the [TextMate documentation][grammar].
